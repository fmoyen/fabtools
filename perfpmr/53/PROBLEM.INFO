Questions that help IBM diagnose the problem:
=============================================

Can you append more detail on the simplest,
  repeatable example of the problem?

  ie.
    Can the problem be demonstrated with the execution
     of a specific command or sequence of events?
      ie. 'ls /slow/fs' takes 60 seconds or
          binary mode 'ftp' put from one specific
            client only runs at 20 Kbytes/second.
          etc.
    If not, describe the least complex example of
      the problem.
    Is the execution of AIX commands also slow?

Is this problem a case of something that had
  worked previously (ie. before a upgrade) and
  now does not run properly?
  If so:
    Describe any other recent changes?
     ie. workload, number of users, networks,
         configuration, etc.

Or is this a case of a application/system/hardware
  that is being set up for the first time?
  If so:
    What performance is expected?
    What is the expectation based on?

Is the slow performance intermittent?
  Is there any pattern to the slow behavior?
  Does it get slow, but then disappear for a while?
  Does it get slow at certain times of day or
    relation to some specific activity?
  About how long does the period of slow performance
    before it returns to normal?
  Is it slow when the system is otherwise idle?
    (ie. capacity vs. elapsed time)
  What is the CPU utilization when the system is
    idle after a period of slow performance
     (use 'vmstat 1')?
     (perhaps something is looping)

Are all applications/commands/users slow or just
  some?

What aspect is slow?
   ie.  Time to echo a character,
        Elapsed time to complete the transaction,,,

Does rebooting the system make the problem disappear
for a while?
 (ie. a resource may be consumed but not freed back up)
 If so, about how long until the problem reappears?

If client/server, can the problem be demonstrated
  when run locally on the server (network vs.
  server issue)?

Does the problem disappear when the application
  is run from the system console?

If client/server, from the client how long does a
  'ping server_ip_address' take?
  (use the server_ip_address to exclude nameserver
   and other variables.  ie. 'ping 129.35.33.22')

If network related, please describe the
  network segments including bandwidth
  (ie. 10mbit/sec, 9600 baud,,) and
  routers between the client and server.

What vendor applications are on the system and
  are they involved in the perf issue (ie. Oracle,
  SAP,,?)?

What is the version/release/level of the vendor
  applications?
